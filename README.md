    <h1>News Aggregator App in Flutter</h1>
    <p>The project under consideration is a mobile application created using Flutter, an open-source framework for building high-performance, high-fidelity, apps for iOS and Android. This app is a news aggregator that retrieves news articles from a RESTful API and displays them in a list. The project makes use of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture pattern, which is a popular approach for managing state and data flow in Flutter applications.</p>
    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>The project consists of the following main components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>main.dart: The entry point of the app that defines the basic structure of the app.</li>
      <li>bloc directory: Contains the BLoC classes that manage the state and data flow of the app.</li>
      <li>data directory: Contains classes for handling network requests and parsing data from the API.</li>
      <li>models directory: Contains classes that define the structure of the data objects used in the app.</li>
      <li>ui directory: Contains the widgets that define the visual elements of the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>API Used</h2>
    <p>The API used in this project is the News API, which provides access to news headlines, articles, and sources from a large range of sources. The API endpoint used to retrieve news articles is <code>https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=business&apiKey=&lt;api_key&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;api_key&gt;</code> is the API key required to access the News API. The API returns data in JSON format, which is then parsed and used to display the news articles in the app.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the project is a well-structured and efficient implementation of a news aggregator app using Flutter and the BLoC architecture pattern. The app demonstrates a practical use of network requests and JSON data parsing, and serves as a good example of a Flutter app that follows best practices.</p>
